## Google AI Blocker

This is a simple script that blocks the Google "AI Overview" from appearing in your search results.

It doesn't stop it from loading, it just stops the user from seeing it. 

You can install it manually from this source code, or you can [download it from the chrome extension store here.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-ai-results-blocker/cnnlcgcbchhbgagkiaphfoiglddejnbh)
